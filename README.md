# HDG2DTriangular 

This project is to implement HDG method on general (unstructured or structured) triangular meshes and then do adaptivity.

Features:

1. general domain and mesh

2. high precision (Multi-precison tool box)

3. Static condensation

4. Adaptive mesh refinement


Toolbox used

1. Distmesh 
2. ameshref
3. cprintf
4. labelpoints
