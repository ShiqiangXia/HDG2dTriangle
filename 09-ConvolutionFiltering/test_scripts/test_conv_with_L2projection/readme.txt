% Test the idea of project uh from triangle mesh to a background square
% mesh and then do convolution postprocessing

% run convolution_test_driver.m 

% uh is defined on triangle mesh Th
% uH is defined on square mesh Th such that Th \subset Th
% uH* = KH * uH  (we test with sin so we also assume the periodic condition)
